                        These are the error codes returned from the AudioFile API.
 @param IHSAudioErrorIHSNotConnected
                        No IHS device connected when trying to play back 3D audio
 @param IHSAudioErrorUnspecifiedError
                        An unspecified error has occurred.
 @param IHSAudioErrorUnsupportedFileTypeError
                        The file type is not supported.
 @param IHSAudioErrorUnsupportedDataFormatError
                        The data format is not supported by this file type.
 @param IHSAudioErrorUnsupportedPropertyError
                        The property is not supported.
 @param IHSAudioErrorBadPropertySizeError
                        The size of the property data was not correct.
 @param IHSAudioErrorPermissionsError
                        The operation violated the file permissions. For example, trying to write to a file opened with kAudioFileReadPermission.
 @param IHSAudioErrorNotOptimizedError
                        There are chunks following the audio data chunk that prevent extending the audio data chunk.
                        The file must be optimized in order to write more audio data.
 @param IHSAudioErrorInvalidChunkError
                        The chunk does not exist in the file or is not supported by the file.
 @param IHSAudioErrorDoesNotAllow64BitDataSizeError
                        The a file offset was too large for the file type. AIFF and WAVE have a 32 bit file size limit.
 @param IHSAudioErrorInvalidPacketOffsetError
                        A packet offset was past the end of the file, or not at the end of the file when writing a VBR format,
                        or a corrupt packet size was read when building the packet table.
 @param IHSAudioErrorInvalidFileError
                        The file is malformed, or otherwise not a valid instance of an audio file of its type.
 @param IHSAudioErrorOperationNotSupportedError
                        The operation cannot be performed. For example, setting kAudioFilePropertyAudioDataByteCount to increase
                        the size of the audio data in a file is not a supported operation. Write the data instead.
 @param IHSAudioErrorNotOpenError
                        The file is closed.
 @param IHSAudioErrorEndOfFileError
                        End of file.
 @param IHSAudioErrorPositionError
                        Invalid file position.
